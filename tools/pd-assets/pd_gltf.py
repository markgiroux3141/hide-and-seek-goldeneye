"""Perfect Dark character/animation -> glTF binary (.glb) exporter.

Turns a PD `chrs/*.bin` into a **skinned** GLB and a PD `animations/*.bin` into a
clip-only GLB, in exactly the shape the engine's existing GoldenEye character
pipeline already consumes (`engine/src/skeletal/gltf_skin.rs` for the body,
`engine/src/skeletal/clip.rs` for the clips). No new Rust loader is needed: a PD
character arrives down the same path a GE one does.

Read `START_HERE.md` section 2 for the underlying PD formats; this file only
covers what is specific to *re-expressing* them as glTF.

# The rig is renamed onto GoldenEye's bone names

The game addresses bones by name — `Bone_9` is the weapon hand, `Bone_3` the
head, `Bone_14`/`Bone_15` the feet (see `game/src/combat/enemy_weapons.rs`). PD's
15 joints are the same 15 joints, numbered differently, so this exporter renames
them onto the GE names and every existing system (weapon attach, head look-at,
foot IK, the aim overlay, the upper-body mask) works on a PD body unmodified.

Which PD part is which was **not** guessed from the +/-X sign. `modeldef.parts`
is a sorted lookup table from `MODELPART_CHR_*` to node, and it settles it
outright, identically across a51guard / dark_frock / maian_soldier / mrblonde:

    MODELPART_CHR_RIGHTHAND (3) -> anim part 8   (the -X arm chain 4->6->8)
    MODELPART_CHR_LEFTHAND  (5) -> anim part 7   (the +X arm chain 3->5->7)
    MODELPART_CHR_0006      (6) -> anim part 2   (the head, HEADSPOT's sibling)

So **-X is the character's right**, and `PART_TO_BONE` below follows from that.

# Bind pose: identity inverse-bind matrices, vertices in bone-local space

PD skins per vertex by binding a bone matrix mid-display-list (`G_MTX`) and then
transforming the raw vertex by that bone's *world* matrix — i.e. PD vertices are
already stored in **bone-local space**. glTF computes `jointMatrix = global(joint)
x inverseBind(joint)`, so writing `inverseBind = identity` and keeping vertices
bone-local makes `jointMatrix` exactly PD's bone world matrix. The conversion is
then a pure re-encoding with no change of space, which is the point: there is no
opportunity for a silent transform error.

(The GoldenEye assets use the other convention — model-space vertices, real
inverse-bind matrices, so their bind pose reduces to identity joint matrices. Both
are valid glTF; nothing in the loader assumes either.)

Consequently a PD body's `bounds_min/max` (a bone-local AABB) is meaningless.
`World::new` only falls back to it when no idle clip loaded, and the PD path
always has one.

# Blend joints are real joints here, not an approximation

A PD `POSITION` node owns up to three matrix slots. Slot 0 is the joint; slots 1
and 2 are *blend* matrices, and `lib/modelasm_c.c:367-430` builds them as the
parent matrix composed with **half** the joint's rotation (the quaternion
half-angle dance at :380-425) — a midpoint frame that hides the seam at a joint.

Rather than fold those vertices onto the owning joint (what `pd_pose.py` does,
and which leaves a visible crease), each blend slot becomes its own glTF joint,
`Blend_<bone>`, sharing the owning bone's parent and rest offset and carrying the
half-rotation per frame. That is exact, not approximate, and costs 4 extra joints
on a 15-bone rig. `--no-blend-joints` reverts to the folded behaviour for A/B.

The 15 named `Bone_*` joints keep their names and roles either way, so nothing
that looks a bone up by name notices the extra joints.

# Units

The engine draws characters at `CHAR_SCALE` (`game/src/world/mod.rs`), a single
global constant, so bodies must arrive in the same units GE bodies use rather
than in metres. `EXPORT_SCALE` converts PD millimetres to those units; the result
is that a PD body needs no per-body scale in the engine. `--metres` overrides it
for inspection in an external tool.

Usage:
    python pd_gltf.py char  <chr.bin> <out.glb>
    python pd_gltf.py clip  <ANIM_ID> <out.glb> [--fps 30]
    python pd_gltf.py batch <manifest.json> <outdir>

    """The per-vertex table a drawable node indexes with its `Vtx.colour` byte.

    Returns `(kind, entries)` where `kind` is `"normal"`, `"colour"` or `""`.

    PD calls this field `colours` (`modelrodata_dl.colours` / `numcolours`,
    `types.h:552`) — and **it is both**, per node. That is the standard F3DEX dual
    use of the vertex colour slot: with `G_LIGHTING` enabled the RSP reads those
    three bytes as a normal, without it as a colour. Measured across the 33 guns'
    174 drawable nodes: **120 hold colours and 54 hold normals**, so neither reading
    alone is right and assuming either one silently wrecks the other's meshes.

    The two are easy to tell apart from the data, which is how this is classified
    rather than guessed:

      * a **normal** table's entries are unit length as signed bytes — `(127,0,0)`
        is +X, `(0,129,0)` is −Y, `(89,167,0)` is (0.7, −0.7, 0);
      * a **colour** table's entries have equal components — `(48,48,48)`,
        `(68,68,68)`, `(136,136,136)` — i.e. greyscale, which is PD's baked
        shading, meant to multiply onto the texture exactly the way the GoldenEye
        weapon GLBs do (see `engine::assets::textured_model`'s own note that "a
        white palette entry tinted by the vertex color gives the real dark metal
        surface color").

    Discarding this is why the guns rendered flat: the loader defaults a missing
    `COLOR_0` to white (so no shading) and a missing `NORMAL` to a single constant
    `(0,1,0)` (so no form, and the viewmodel matcap collapses to one texel).

    `Vtx.colour` is a **byte offset** into the table, not an element index — the
    observed values run 0, 4, 8 … 252, i.e. 64 entries of 4 bytes.

    Two layouts, because the node types differ:
      * `DL` (0x18) carries a real `colours` pointer at 0x08 and `numcolours` at 0x16.
      * `GUNDL` (0x04) has neither, so its table follows the vertex array — the same
        segment-6 convention `pd_model._run_dl` already assumes.
